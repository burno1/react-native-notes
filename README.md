The application must be able to CRUD (create, change, read and remove) annotations (small texts with a title and content).
Each operation must have its own screen, with the exception of removal, which can be performed along with the listing of notes.

**Main requirement**: annotations must be stored through Reducer Hooks and Context and shared between the different application screens.
